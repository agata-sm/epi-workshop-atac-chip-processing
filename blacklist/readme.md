# Blacklist preparation

Blacklisted regions were downloaded from ENCODE (the original accession in file names).

The coordinates were lift over to mm39 using the web interface at UCSC Genome Browser.
Files with lift over coordinates are suffived by `mm39`.

Files suffixed by `ens` have the **chr** prefix removed from the assembled chromosome names.
